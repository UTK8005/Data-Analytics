This project deals with the records for 5,000,000+ commercial airline flights in 2015, compiled for the U.S. DOT Air Travel
Consumer Report. Each record represents a single flight, including the airline name, flight
number, origin/destination airport and flight distance, as well as scheduled/actual departure
and arrival times.

Analysis Done were on the following grounds :
1) How does the overall flight volume vary by month? By day of week?
2) What percentage of flights in experienced a departure delay in 2015?
 Among those flights, what was the average delay time, in minutes?
3) How does the % of delayed flights vary throughout the year?
  What about for flights leaving from Boston (BOS) specifically?
4)  How many flights were cancelled in 2015?
  What % of cancellations were due to weather?
  What % were due to the Airline/Carrier?
5) Which airlines seem to be most and least reliable, in terms of on-time departure?
